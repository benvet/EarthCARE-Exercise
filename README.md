The three notebooks contain:
  - 1.0 The featuremask in a 500km radius around Halifax
  - 1.1 The featuremask in a 1000km radius around Halifax
  - The partical backscatter coefficient in the desired latitude range.
    
Note that beyond netCDF4, numpy, matplotlib I use the geopy package to calculate geodesic distance.
